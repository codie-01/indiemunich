        <section id="how-we-collect">
          <h3>3. How We Collect Personal Data (Art. 13(1)(e))</h3>
          <p>We collect information through:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Booking and sign-up tools (Calendly, Tally, Patreon)</li>
            <li>Payment services (Stripe, PayPal, direct bank transfers)</li>
            <li>Messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Instagram DM, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, email)</li>

          <p>
            We also receive some personal data indirectly from third-party services such as Calendly, Tally, Patreon,
            Stripe, PayPal, WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook when you interact with us on those platforms.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you post a public review of Indie Munich (for example on Google Business), the content is processed under
            the terms of the relevant platform. We may view these reviews but we do not copy or store them outside the
            platform.
          </p>

          <h4>Cookies and Tracking</h4>
          <p>

        <!-- 4. Why We Process Personal Data -->
        <section id="why-we-process">
          <h3>4. Why We Process Personal Data &amp; Legal Bases (Art. 13(1)(c), Art. 6 GDPR)</h3>
          <p>
            We process your personal data for the following purposes and based on the following lawful bases:
          </p>

          <h4>A. Performance of a Contract – Art. 6(1)(b)</h4>
          <p>To:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Process registrations for events, workshops or classes</li>
            <li>Confirm bookings</li>
            <li>Provide access to paid activities</li>
            <li>Manage attendance and communication around events</li>
            <li>Process payments through third-party providers</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>B. Legitimate Interests – Art. 6(1)(f)</h4>
          <p>We process data when necessary for the operation, organisation and growth of Indie Munich, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Coordinating with musicians, performers and workshop participants</li>
            <li>Managing events, communication and community activities</li>
            <li>Maintaining and promoting our artistic community</li>
            <li>Ensuring the safety and smooth running of events</li>
            <li>Using photos and videos for documentation and promotional purposes</li>
            <li>Communicating with you about relevant Indie Munich events or updates</li>
            <li>Understanding social-media engagement</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>Event Photos &amp; Videos</h5>
          <p>
            We may capture general photos and videos at events for the purpose of documenting and promoting Indie Munich.
          </p>
          <p>We take steps to respect privacy, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Informing attendees through event descriptions and/or signs at venues</li>
            <li>Avoiding focused images of individuals who indicate they do not wish to be photographed</li>
            <li>Offering simple ways to object (see Section 11)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            In addition to the GDPR, the publication of identifiable photographs or video recordings is also subject to the
            German Kunsturhebergesetz (KUG), in particular §§ 22–23.
          </p>

          <p>
            These provisions require that recognisable images of individuals may only be published with permission, unless a
            statutory exception applies (for example, images taken as part of a public event without focusing on a single
            identifiable person).
          </p>

          <p>Indie Munich respects these rights and applies the following approach:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              We normally take wide-angle or group shots that show the atmosphere of an event rather than focusing on
              individuals.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where we publish images in which a person is clearly identifiable, we rely on either a statutory exception under
              § 23 KUG or the individual’s permission.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can object at any time to being shown in photographs or videos, and we will avoid capturing you or remove
              identifiable content wherever reasonably possible.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Automated Decision-Making</strong></p>
          <p>
            We do not use personal data for automated decision-making or profiling within the meaning of Article 22 GDPR.
          </p>

          <h4>C. Consent – Art. 6(1)(a)</h4>
          <p>We only use consent where we actively request it. For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Optional newsletters or promotional updates (if introduced)</li>
            <li>Featuring a specific individual prominently in a promotional campaign</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Consent can be withdrawn at any time.</p>

          <h4>D. Legal Obligations – Art. 6(1)(c)</h4>
          <p>
            We may process information if required by law, for example for accounting and tax retention obligations relating
            to payment records.

        <section id="who-we-share-with">
          <h3>5. Who We Share Data With (Art. 13(1)(e))</h3>
          <p>We share data only when necessary to operate our community activities, such as:</p>

          <h4>Event Operations</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Event venues</li>
            <li>Workshop instructors</li>
            <li>Collaborating musicians and artists</li>
            <li>Photographers/videographers for event coverage</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Stripe</li>
            <li>PayPal</li>
            <li>Patreon</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Communication &amp; Coordination Tools</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, Telegram</li>
            <li>Email service providers (Gmail)</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Marketing &amp; Promotion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Social-media platforms where photos/videos are posted</li>
            <li>Google Business (public reviews)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            We may also share photos, videos or promotional materials with the musicians, workshop hosts or collaborators
            involved in a specific event where it is reasonably connected to documenting or promoting that event.
          </p>

          <p>
            Photographers or videographers who cover events act as independent creators, not processors of Indie Munich. They
            process any images under their own professional responsibility.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you interact with us on platforms such as Instagram or Facebook, those platforms also process your personal
            data under their own responsibility. Indie Munich does not control how these platforms collect or use personal
            data. Please refer to the privacy policies of the respective platform operators.
          </p>

          <p>Indie Munich does not sell personal data.</p>

          <h3>8. Security Measures (Art. 32)</h3>
          <p>
            We take appropriate steps to protect personal data against unauthorised access, misuse, loss or disclosure. Our
            measures are based on Article 32 GDPR and the relevant provisions of the Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (BDSG), in
            particular §§ 62 and 64, which require data controllers to implement suitable technical and organisational
            measures (“TOMs”).
          </p>

          <p>Indie Munich applies the following TOMs appropriate to the size and nature of our organisation:</p>

          <h4>Access Control &amp; Authorisation</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Personal data is accessible only to a small number of authorised organisers.</li>
            <li>Access rights are limited to what is needed for event and community management.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Account &amp; Device Security</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Password protection for all accounts used for Indie Munich activities.</li>
            <li>Two-factor authentication (2FA) activated where possible (Google, Instagram, Stripe, etc.).</li>
            <li>
              Personal laptops and smartphones used for Indie Munich purposes are protected by device passcodes and screen
              locks.
            </li>
            <li>Use of reputable password-management tools by organisers.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Transmission &amp; Storage Security</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Communication via encrypted messaging platforms (WhatsApp, Instagram DM, Telegram).</li>
            <li>Storage of email-based data in secure Gmail accounts with 2FA.</li>
            <li>
              Minimal long-term storage: most data remains within the service where it was originally collected (Calendly,
              Stripe, PayPal, Patreon).
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Data Minimisation &amp; Retention</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Data is kept only as long as necessary (see Retention section).</li>
            <li>Temporary printed lists are securely disposed of after use.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Confidentiality &amp; Awareness</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Individuals handling data are instructed to treat it confidentially and use it only for Indie Munich purposes.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Ongoing Review</h4>
          <p>
            These measures are reviewed periodically and updated where necessary as our activities evolve.
          </p>

          <p>
            Certain authorised organisers may use their personal laptops or mobile devices for Indie Munich activities. These
            devices are protected with passwords, device-lock features and, where available, two-factor authentication.
