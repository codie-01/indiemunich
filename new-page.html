üåÄ Indie Munich Community Guidelines
To keep Indie Munich respectful, transparent, and professional, we ask everyone to follow these guidelines:
Representation: Only Ryan Inglis & Carolin Kumari represent Indie Munich officially. No one else may present themselves as speaking for the brand or the whole community.
Community Member: anyone in the network, free to share, connect, and collaborate.
Team Member: Indie Munich management (Ryan & Carolin) or selected entrusted volunteers with official responsibilities.
Boundaries: Respect personal and professional boundaries. If someone sets a limit, accept it.
Transparency: Be clear and upfront when offering professional services. No hidden fees or surprise charges (e.g. offering ‚Äúfree‚Äù photos and later billing artists at full price).
Respect: Communicate in a professional and constructive way. Undermining, manipulative, or passive-aggressive behaviour is not acceptable.
No Exploitation: Don‚Äôt misuse the community for fake management/booking offers or other ways of taking advantage of members.
Responsibility: Indie Munich is open to everyone, but we cannot verify every background. Please use good judgment when collaborating.
‚öñÔ∏è Repeated violations of these guidelines may result in removal from the community.
